            HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language" and it is a programming
            language used to build and design web pages. HTML is essential in
            web development, as it is used to structure and format content on
            electronic pages. HTML is a descriptive language that uses tags to
            describe how content should be displayed on the page, such as
            specifying page headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and
            more. The HTML code is understood and interpreted by web browsers
            (such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to display the content in
            the desired format. Developers can use HTML in conjunction with CSS
            (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to add additional formatting
            and interactions to web pages.

            CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and it is a style sheet
            language used to describe the presentation of a document written in
            HTML or XML. CSS is used to control the layout, design, and
            appearance of web pages, allowing developers to define styles such
            as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of elements on a webpage.

            JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language that
            is primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on
            websites. It is a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs on
            the user's web browser rather than on the server. JavaScript allows
            developers to add functionality such as form validation, animations,
            and interactive elements to web pages. It is supported by all modern
            web browsers and is an essential tool for front-end web development.
